Session 1 - Initializer Agent
==============================
Date: 2026-02-07

COMPLETED:
1. Read and analyzed app_spec.txt (complete game specification)
2. Created feature_list.json with 241 test cases (181 functional, 60 style)
   - 31 tests have 10+ steps
   - All tests start with passes: false
   - Ordered by priority (foundational features first)
3. Created init.sh for environment setup
4. Set up project structure:
   - Vite 6 + TypeScript 5 (strict mode) + Phaser 3.80+
   - package.json with dependencies
   - tsconfig.json with strict mode
   - vite.config.ts
   - index.html with orientation detection, rules modal HTML
5. Created core data models:
   - Domino (id, topIndex, bottomIndex, available, isDouble, toJSON/fromJSON)
   - TileConfig (maxPip parameter, getTileCount)
   - PlayerHand (tiles, score, playerType, position, name)
   - BoardState (branch nums, phases, offsets, placedTiles, config)
   - GameState (central state container, serializable)
6. Created managers:
   - DeckManager (tile generation, shuffling, distribution)
   - ThemeManager (JSON theme loading, asset path resolution)
   - AudioManager (sound playback, mute toggle, localStorage persistence)
   - ScoreManager (pass point scoring, EventBus integration)
   - SlotHelper (5-phase board placement algorithm, position calculation)
7. Created AI system:
   - AIStrategy interface
   - RandomStrategy (picks random valid tile)
   - HardStrategy (classifies tiles as good/bad relative to next player)
   - EasyStrategy (helps human, CausePass analysis, prefers non-double good tiles)
8. Created scenes:
   - MenuScene (title, difficulty buttons, rules button, mute toggle, scene transitions)
   - GameScene (full gameplay: dealing, drag-and-drop, AI turns, pass, game over, pause menu)
9. All TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
10. Vite dev server starts and serves the game correctly

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Tile generation is parameterized by maxPip (not hardcoded to 28)
- All game state classes have toJSON/fromJSON serialization
- EventBus decouples game logic from rendering
- Player identity abstracted (human/ai/remote types)
- Theme system fully decouples asset paths from code
- AI strategies separated from controller for testability

NEXT STEPS (Session 2):
- Create tile-back.png asset (currently missing from theme)
- Create sprite sheet or verify individual tile images work
- Test the game in browser via automation
- Fix any runtime issues found during testing
- Verify tile dealing animation
- Test drag-and-drop functionality
- Begin working through feature_list.json test cases
