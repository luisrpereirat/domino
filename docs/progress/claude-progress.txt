Session 1 - Initializer Agent
==============================
Date: 2026-02-07

COMPLETED:
1. Read and analyzed app_spec.txt (complete game specification)
2. Created feature_list.json with 241 test cases (181 functional, 60 style)
   - 31 tests have 10+ steps
   - All tests start with passes: false
   - Ordered by priority (foundational features first)
3. Created init.sh for environment setup
4. Set up project structure:
   - Vite 6 + TypeScript 5 (strict mode) + Phaser 3.80+
   - package.json with dependencies
   - tsconfig.json with strict mode
   - vite.config.ts
   - index.html with orientation detection, rules modal HTML
5. Created core data models:
   - Domino (id, topIndex, bottomIndex, available, isDouble, toJSON/fromJSON)
   - TileConfig (maxPip parameter, getTileCount)
   - PlayerHand (tiles, score, playerType, position, name)
   - BoardState (branch nums, phases, offsets, placedTiles, config)
   - GameState (central state container, serializable)
6. Created managers:
   - DeckManager (tile generation, shuffling, distribution)
   - ThemeManager (JSON theme loading, asset path resolution)
   - AudioManager (sound playback, mute toggle, localStorage persistence)
   - ScoreManager (pass point scoring, EventBus integration)
   - SlotHelper (5-phase board placement algorithm, position calculation)
7. Created AI system:
   - AIStrategy interface
   - RandomStrategy (picks random valid tile)
   - HardStrategy (classifies tiles as good/bad relative to next player)
   - EasyStrategy (helps human, CausePass analysis, prefers non-double good tiles)
8. Created scenes:
   - MenuScene (title, difficulty buttons, rules button, mute toggle, scene transitions)
   - GameScene (full gameplay: dealing, drag-and-drop, AI turns, pass, game over, pause menu)
9. All TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
10. Vite dev server starts and serves the game correctly

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Tile generation is parameterized by maxPip (not hardcoded to 28)
- All game state classes have toJSON/fromJSON serialization
- EventBus decouples game logic from rendering
- Player identity abstracted (human/ai/remote types)
- Theme system fully decouples asset paths from code
- AI strategies separated from controller for testability

Session 2 - Bug Fixes and Project Organization
================================================
Date: 2026-02-07

COMPLETED:
1. Fixed tile-back.png 404 error:
   - Added procedural texture generation in GameScene.create() (brown rounded rect
     with diamond pattern) as fallback when tile-back.png is missing from theme
   - Removed broken preload attempt
2. Fixed audio 404 errors:
   - Removed sound loading from preload in both MenuScene and GameScene
   - AudioManager already handles missing sounds gracefully
3. Fixed critical drag-and-drop bug (GameScene.ts:690-716):
   - Bug: clearGhostSlots() destroyed ghost slot graphics BEFORE findNearestSlot()
     could read their stored slotPosition data
   - Fix: moved clearGhostSlots() after findNearestSlot()
   - Also fixed always-true condition (ghostSlots.length >= 0 -> > 0)
   - Verified with 2 successful drag-and-drop placements via Playwright
4. Organized project file structure:
   - Created docs/progress/ for session progress notes (committed)
   - Created docs/screenshots/ for test verification screenshots (gitignored)
   - Moved claude-progress.txt to docs/progress/
   - Updated .gitignore, CLAUDE.md, prompts/initializer_prompt.md,
     prompts/coding_prompt.md with file placement rules
5. Added window.__PHASER_GAME__ debug reference in main.ts

BUGS FOUND AND FIXED:
- tile-back.png missing from theme -> procedural fallback
- Sound files missing from sounds/ -> removed preload, AudioManager handles gracefully
- Drag-and-drop broken -> ghost slots destroyed before being read

VERIFIED WORKING:
- MenuScene renders: title, Easy/Random/Hard buttons, Rules button, Sound toggle
- GameScene renders: all 4 hands, tile backs, board, turn indicator, scores
- Tile dealing animation with stagger
- AI turns execute (flip animation + placement)
- Human drag-and-drop tile placement (2 successful placements confirmed)
- Turn cycling (human -> AI -> AI -> AI -> human)
- Pass point scoring
- Valid/invalid tile highlighting (glow for valid, dimmed for invalid)
- Double tiles placed standing (vertical orientation)

Session 3 - Feature Completion (241/241 tests passing)
======================================================
Date: 2026-02-07

COMPLETED:
1. Sound system implementation:
   - Generated 9 WAV sound files (tile-place, tile-pickup, tile-deal, pass,
     game-start, game-over, button-click, game-win, game-lose)
   - Added sound preloading in GameScene and MenuScene
   - Added gameWin/gameLose to theme.json
   - All sounds load and play correctly (verified via Playwright)

2. UI feature improvements:
   - AI thinking indicator: animated dots cycling (0-3 dots, 400ms interval)
   - Drop shadow on dragged tiles (visible during drag, hidden on release)
   - Disabled button state: pass button shows at 50% opacity when disabled
   - Touch targets: mute button padding increased to meet 44px minimum
   - Rotate device message: SVG rotation icon replacing emoji
   - Pass button hidden during AI turns, disabled (50% alpha) during player
     turns with valid moves, active (100% alpha) when player must pass

3. PWA implementation:
   - manifest.json with app name, icons, standalone display, landscape orientation
   - Service worker (sw.js) with cache-first for static, network-first for theme.json
   - PWA icons at 192x192 and 512x512 (domino tile design on green background)
   - SW registration in main.ts
   - Meta tags in index.html (theme-color, manifest link, apple-touch-icon)
   - Production build: 3.0MB (well under 20MB limit)

4. Theme system:
   - Created "Ocean" theme (copy of classic with blue color scheme)
   - Theme selector in MenuScene (top-left button, cycles through themes)
   - Theme hot-swap via scene restart (no full page refresh)
   - Phaser registry persists theme selection across restarts

5. End-to-end gameplay verified:
   - Full game from menu to human win (Easy AI, 121 moves)
   - Fish condition triggered (Hard AI, 113 moves, "Fish - Game Over")
   - Restart cycle (pause menu -> restart -> fresh game)
   - Multiple games played through automated Playwright loops

6. Feature list: 241/241 tests passing (100%)

ALL SESSION GOALS MET - Project feature-complete.
